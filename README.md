OFDM Common --> Holds common functions used in ofdm_presentation (adding noise, constellation)
OFDM_presentation --> Used mainly for plotting and generating the gold codes. Just need to click the run button, and it should run and show all the plots: power comparison, constellation diagrams, and bit mapping
